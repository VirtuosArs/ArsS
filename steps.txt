Install Koala : http://koala-app.com/

Install node.js : https://nodejs.org/en/

Create a folder and open cp=ommand prompt there and use the following lines to install the required components

npm install -g bower

bower install bootstrap-sass --save

By doing thsi automatically bowercomponents folder will be created in our folder

Create required folders like sass, css, img and others if you wish

Add app.scss in sass folder
In app.scss import the required files which you want e.g
@import "../bower_components/bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap";
@import "../bower_components/bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap-compass";
@import "../bower_components/font-awesome/scss/font-awesome";


Then select the sass folder from our project through koala and set it to auto compile.
Once that is done our sass folder will compile and the compiled file of app.css will be craeted in css folder

Then create index.html and copy the Simple template from 
"view-source:https://getbootstrap.com/examples/starter-template/"

Remove the unwanted lines and add the required files e.g
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/app.css">

<script src="bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/bootstrap-sass/assets/javascripts/bootstrap.js"></script>


And also change <nav class="navbar navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top"> to <nav class="navbar navbar-default">

Installing live server: (one time activity)
npm install -g live-server
live-server (for default port) or 
live-server --port = 8000


Now copy the contents of "OurFolder\bower_components\bootstrap-sass\assets\stylesheets\bootstrap\_variables.scss" and paste it into new file in our sass folder by name "_customVariables.scss" update this file as per your requirements, add any colors to pallete and save it
Similarly add _functions.scss with the following code
@function set-text-color($color){
  @if(lightness($color) > 50){
    @return #000000;
  } @else {
    @return #ffffff;
  }
}

and _custom.scss where any additional styling which we want to give will go in this file


Thenimport the above file in app.scss by the following line
@import "customVariables";
@import "functions";
@import "custom";


Now create your own web pages and style them as you wish!!!
